  <h2>Hi, I’m Abhishek Adhikari</h2>
  <p>
    I’m a designer who brings ideas to life. With over two years of experience in
    UI/UX, graphic design, blogging, content writing, and digital marketing, I’ve honed
    a craft focused on clarity, empathy, and engaging user experiences.
  </p>
  <p>
    In UI/UX, I explore human behavior and problem-solving design to make products more
    enjoyable. In graphic design, I love the intersection of art and communication—whether
    building a logo, illustration, or a full brand identity.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a writer, I connect with readers through clear language, compelling storytelling,
    and thoughtful analysis. From blog posts and product copy to social campaigns, I’m
    mindful of audience and message.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’m passionate about helping businesses grow in the online world—from social strategy
    to SEO—and creating content that resonates. Let’s make something great together.
